### About
"In order to be well-traveled, one must Travel Well."
TravelWell is an app based off of the New York Times, 36 Hours. It is a travel app that gives you an itinerary for (currently) 3 cities -- Austin, Seattle and New Orleans. The user starts by selecting one of the available destinations and then selecting how long they will be visiting the city. An iternary will be generated for the user allowing them to explore the city "like a local."

### Technologies Used
* Express/Node.js
* Mongoose for MongoDB
* AngularJS
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap

### Approach Taken
I was excited about this project for many reasons -- I came into General Assembly wanting to do a travel app for my final project. The idea started coming together after taking a trip to Vancouver and using the New York Times' 36 hour itinerary there. It got my wheels spinning on a scalable version of that -- what if a traveler is there for 1 day or 5 days?! And so my project was born. I started by thinking of the User Experience, making it the least amount of clicks to reach their destination, while making their path very clear. I then implemented the database schema and worked through the backend functionality making my way to the front end views.

### Upcoming Additions
* Add auth for users to save & share particular activities or trips
* Allow for users to sign up to "build a trip" -- whether it be on their own or with a private group 
* ALlow for voting and commenting on activities in each city
